# Ollie Finn's README

### Introduction

Hello. As you've probably already guessed, this is my README file. If you're familiar with such files you should already 
have some context as to its purpose, if not you can read more about README files [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README). 

This file serves as my documentation of sorts and should provide details as to what I'm all about and will hopefully 
answer some icebreaker questions. 

This document is work-in-progress, so it will change and evolve over time.

Something that's important to note is that the existence of this file is not intended to be a replacement to us getting 
to know one another personally.

### Me - Personally 

- I live in Vienna, Austria, with my wife Maz.
- We have a 14-year-old Spaniel called Penny.
- I'm originally from the United Kingdom.
- I'm a technology enthusiast.
- I'm particularly interested in anything with an engine.
- I'm a huge fan of EDM. I've even released my own [track](https://open.spotify.com/artist/49Rg8qKcvKEH6jui5ppnmu?si=GRd24ligQVqf9wbvm8mdcw), but don't worry I won't be giving up my day job any time soon.
- I'm vegan, but not the preachy kind.

### My Purpose

To put it simply, my purpose is to help the company succeed, but, the same could (and should) be said about everyone working 
here so what about my specific mission? Well, that can also be put simply, my mission is to help the engineering team be 
the best that they possibly can be.

Although these words are easy to say, succeeding in this mission will take time and effort and will require us all to 
have confidence in each other, ourselves, and what we do, as well as the rest of the company having confidence in us. 

To accomplish this mission you can always expect me to:

- Be respectful to everyone, all the time.
- Communicate early and often, especially on matters that have an impact on the work of others.
- Be as data-informed as possible, while also relying on instinct when and where necessary.
- Have the best interests of the company in mind at all times, and to be committed to its success.

Likewise, I'll expect these from your too.

If you feel I'm not doing any of these as well as you'd like, let me know, I take constructive criticism very well.

### Assumptions

- You're working here because you're very good at what you do. 
- You'll let me know if there's something preventing you from doing what you do.
- You're probably better than me at at-least something (work related).
- You'll always have the best intentions in mind.
- You feel comfortable asking me questions and debating ideas.

### Core Beliefs

- [Respect](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/293940) and/is [common sense](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/286967).
- Heroes are great, but teams are better. Proof in point; [The Avengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)).
- Communication is key, but [the right kind of communication](https://www.zacsky.com/blog/2018/1/communicate-early-and-often-to-build-trust) is fundamental.
- There is no time for [Ego](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/279633)
- Hold each other and ourselves [accountable](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cywakeman/2015/10/26/personal-accountability-and-the-pursuit-of-workplace-happiness/#5061bfe71ca2)

All of these stem from the many years I spent Rowing while at school and university. The pinnacle of this time was representing 
my university at the [Henley Royal Regatta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henley_Royal_Regatta), and although we didn't 
win anything, the journey there i.e. the many years of training twice a day, taught me the importance of all the above points. 

### How I Can Help You?

- **Remove roadblocks**. Things inevitably get in the way, I'll do my best to unblock you or better still ensure you have 
all the necessary tools to help you unblock yourself.
- **Help you grow and achieve career success**. You know better than I do about how you'd like to grow, but I'll do my best 
to provide opportunities for growth and learning. 
- **Firefight**. Shit happens, especially when you move quickly. Please share your mistakes. _"A mistake, if shared, becomes 
a challenge; if hidden, becomes a failure" - Someone smart_
- **Celebrate your success**. When things go well, and you're not one to blow your own trumpet, let me do it for you.
- **Always have your back**. We're all in this together, hopefully for a long time, so your long-term well-being is hugely 
important. That said, I'm not a mind-reader, so please let me know if you feel there's anything more I could be doing.

### How You Can Help Me

- **Do what you do best, and do the best you can**. This goes without saying. If there's anything preventing you from doing 
this, let me know.
- **Ask questions**. If you feel like I've not explained something enough, or you need more context, let me know.
- **Tell me if I do something wrong**. I'm not perfect, and I don't know everything, so I will make mistakes. To help me not 
make the same mistakes again I need to know, so please, let me know.

### How I Communicate

As I've already mentioned, the right kind of communication is fundamental to success. With that in mind I'll always try to 
prioritise communicating appropriately as and when required. Please be mindful of what might be the best method to discuss 
something.

Regardless, if I ever send a message out of working hours please know that I'm not expecting a response there and then.

#### Email 

For less urgent matters emails are great but that's not to say you'll be waiting hours for a response. I read all of my 
emails and endeavour to respond as quickly as possible, so I'm not a bottleneck. 

#### Slack

For anything urgent, or if you'd just like to chat, Slack is your best bet. Feel free to message me, or if you'd prefer an 
actual conversation I'm always open to a voice or video call.

#### 1:1

1:1's are all about you, so the cadence, length, duration and content is up to you so please let me know what works best and 
I'll work around that. The only thing I would ask is that you share your topics beforehand, so I can prepare if necessary. 

### Known Failure Modes

This is by no means exhaustive.

#### I'm An Introvert 

Please don't confuse my quiet with a lack of interest. If I have something to say I'll say it, but I generally don't suffer 
from verbal diarrhea, and I find prolonged exposure to large groups of other humans tiring. What can I say, I'm working on it!

#### I'm visual

My mind processes visual resources more efficiently than lots of spoken words. This tends to mean that I'll ask a lot of 
questions for clarity, and I'll also try to visualise ideas as much as possible.
